# CRPlayerAnalytics

Using Royale API to get real time data on my wins and losses to analyze my win percentage, opponents faced, deck versus data and creating full fletched analysis of if I can make it to Ultimate Chamption :)

Tools to use:
Royale API for data prep

Python + Maybe scala if i want to use Spark

Tableau for visualizations if any

Plotly for viz as well if needed


Idea Inspo:
I havent played this game in over a year but came across a dude on ig who did a similar thing and used data analysis to try going pro. I am definitely not pro level lmao but i was really close to being game "elite" while being free to play so i wanted to test out whether I can pull this off.
The idea is to create a real time script first thata actively updates my dataset and accounts for dupe entries. once sample size is big enough(i played enough), i can do play by play analysis. 

Realistically an LLM will only ever come into play if an when i strategize how to improve my performance and i need recommendations. We are not even close to that stage yet. We will also need to deal with real time data so that our analysis can scale for time. 

EDIT:

I booted the game up after a year and it is already not looking good :(
